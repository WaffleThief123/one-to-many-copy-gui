### Why am I here?
Because there's no good easy tool for syncing to multiple destinations from one destination in the form of a platform agnostic, GUI application. 

It works for local paths and UNC shares (if you're on windows)

# By default, it doesn't touch the following extensions. I need to work on the adjustment workflow for this, but for now it's what's there. 
```
    ".tmp",
    ".bak",
    ".log",
    ".DS_Store",
    ".DS_store"
```


## Bugs?
Open an issue, attach relevant and anonomized snippets from your file-transfer.log file. 



### How do I use this?
You don't. Not until I upload screenshots. Or if you're brave enough to venture forth on your own, have some text instructions.
